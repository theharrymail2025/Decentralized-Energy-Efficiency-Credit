# Decentralized Energy Efficiency Credit System

## Overview

The Decentralized Energy Efficiency Credit System provides a blockchain-based framework for measuring, verifying, tokenizing, and trading energy efficiency improvements. This system creates economic incentives for building owners and energy consumers to implement energy-saving measures by converting verified reductions in energy consumption into tradable digital assets. By establishing a trustless mechanism for validating energy savings, the platform enables a market-driven approach to accelerating energy efficiency adoption.

## Core Components
